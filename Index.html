                <h2>Bar Chart</h2>
                <p>What is a bar chart? A bar chart (aka bar graph, column chart) plots numeric values for levels of a categorical feature as bars. Levels are plotted on one chart axis, and values are plotted on the other axis. Each categorical value claims one bar, and the length of each bar corresponds to the bar's value.</p>

                    <h2>Stacked Bar Chart</h2>
                    <p>A stacked bar chart is a type of bar chart that portrays the compositions and comparisons of several variables through time. Stacked charts usually represent a series of bars or columns stacked on top of one another. They are widely used to effectively portray comparisons of total values across several categories.</p>

                  <h2>HeatMap Chart</h2>
                  <p>What is a heatmap? A heatmap (aka heat map) depicts values for a main variable of interest across two axis variables as a grid of colored squares. The axis variables are divided into ranges like a bar chart or histogram, and each cell's color indicates the value of the main variable in the corresponding cell range.</p>

                <h2>Alluvial Chart</h2>
                <p>Alluvial diagrams are a type of flow diagram originally developed to represent changes in network structure over time. In allusion to both their visual appearance and their emphasis on flow, alluvial diagrams are named after alluvial fans that are naturally formed by the soil deposited from streaming water</p>
                <P>In an alluvial diagram, blocks represent clusters of nodes, and stream fields between the blocks represent changes in the composition of these clusters over time. The height of a block represents the size of the cluster and the height of a stream field represents the size of the components contained in both blocks connected by the stream field.</P>
                <p><b>What is the difference between Sankey and alluvial?</b>
                  In a nutshell, the main difference between the two charts is that in an alluvial diagram, all target nodes go through a middle step â€“ in a multi-step sankey, that's not the case</p>

                        In the third exercise, in the minimum, average and maximum temperature for the linear chart, only the first 5 years have been used, and in the radar chart, the first 3 years have been used, because with the increase in the number of years, the displayed data became extremely illegible and unclear.

                            In the third chart, the entire year period between 1895 and 2023 is applied
                            
                            And in all three exercises, only the data of one city has been used</P>

                <h2>Line Chart</h2>
                    <p>A line chart, also known as a line graph or curve chart, is a graphical representation used to display data points connected by straight lines. This type of chart is particularly useful for visualizing trends, changes, and relationships in data over a continuous interval, often time.</p>

					<h2>Radar Chart</h2>
                    <p>A radar chart displays multivariate data stacked at an axis with the same central point. The chart features three or more quantitative variables for comparison; these variables are known as radii. The map looks similar to the spider web, which is why it's also called a spider chart.</p>
